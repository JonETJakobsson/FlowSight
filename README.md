# FlowSight
Analyse data from the Amnis FlowSight to facilitate machine learning and 3rd party analysis. 

Export features for each particle as .txt files using IDEAS software.

Create a dictionary that links an "experiment name" to the exported .txt file.

Create a folder called data/"experiment name"/ and export all particle images as tiff files to this directory for each experiment.
